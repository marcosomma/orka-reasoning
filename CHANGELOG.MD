## [0.9.4] ¬∑ 2025-10-03 üîß
### Fixed
* **üîß Final Agent Logging - Integration Test Fix**
  * **ORKA-FINAL Marker Missing** - Fixed execution engine early return paths that bypassed `[ORKA-FINAL]` log message
  * **Integration Test Compatibility** - Ensured final agent ID is always logged before returning response for CLI integration tests
  * **Logging Consistency** - Added `[ORKA-FINAL]` log to all return paths in `_extract_final_response` method
  * **Files Updated** - `orka/orchestrator/execution_engine.py` (lines 1143-1154) - added logging before early returns

* **üîß Critical Agent Output Standardization - JSON Serialization**
  * **DateTime Serialization Fix** - Fixed `ResponseBuilder` returning non-JSON-serializable `datetime` objects causing failures in trace generation and agent communication
  * **Standardized Response Format** - All `OrkaResponse` objects now use ISO 8601 timestamp strings (`datetime.now().isoformat()`) ensuring consistent JSON serialization
  * **Agent Pipeline Reliability** - Eliminated "Object of type datetime is not JSON serializable" errors that broke workflow execution and trace saving
  * **Backward Compatibility** - Response structure unchanged except timestamp format now string-based instead of datetime object
  * **Files Updated** - `orka/response_builder.py` (lines 75, 142) - converted `datetime.now()` to `datetime.now().isoformat()` in success and error responses

* **‚ö° GraphScout Multi-Agent Path Execution - Critical Routing Fix**
  * **Full Path Execution** - Fixed `_apply_memory_routing_logic` in execution engine only executing first agent from GraphScout's multi-hop path instead of complete sequence
  * **Path Array Extraction** - Enhanced to extract full `path` array from GraphScout candidates (e.g., `["agent1", "agent2", "agent3"]`) instead of only `node_id`
  * **Memory Agent Positioning** - Improved intelligent positioning of memory reader agents (beginning) and memory writer agents (end) of execution sequences
  * **Workflow Completion** - GraphScout now correctly executes complete multi-agent paths like `cognitive_architecture_loop ‚Üí narrative_storyteller ‚Üí philosophical_analyzer`
  * **Files Updated** - `orka/orchestrator/execution_engine.py` (lines 1506-1545) - rewrote candidate processing to iterate through full path arrays

* **üéØ Enhanced Agent Coordination & Context Flow**
  * **Complete Sequence Execution** - Multi-hop intelligent routing now functional with all agents in GraphScout shortlist executing in proper order
  * **Context Preservation** - Fixed context passing between agents in GraphScout-routed sequences ensuring proper data flow
  * **Response Builder Integration** - Response builder now properly positioned at end of execution paths for final output formatting
  * **Agent Output Consistency** - All agent types (LocalLLMAgent, GraphScoutAgent, Memory nodes) now return consistently formatted responses

### Enhanced

  * **Path Discovery Visibility** - Improved logging for GraphScout path evaluation, scoring, and selection decisions
  * **Agent-Level Traceability** - Better execution traces showing complete agent sequences and decision points
  * **Memory Agent Detection** - Enhanced logging for memory agent positioning and special routing logic

### Technical Details
* **Root Cause Analysis** - GraphScout was generating correct multi-hop paths but execution engine only extracted `node_id` field instead of full `path` array from candidates
* **Solution Strategy** - Modified `_apply_memory_routing_logic` to extract `candidate.get("path")` and iterate through all agents in sequence with memory agent special handling
* **JSON Serialization** - Timestamp standardization eliminates datetime object serialization errors throughout agent communication pipeline and trace generation
* **Impact** - Enables sophisticated multi-agent reasoning patterns with GraphScout intelligent routing working as designed
* **Testing** - Verified with 30+ workflow executions showing correct multi-hop path execution and proper agent output formatting

### Migration Notes
* **For Existing Users** - No breaking changes; workflows continue unchanged with improved GraphScout routing reliability
* **Response Format** - `OrkaResponse.timestamp` now returns ISO 8601 string format (e.g., "2025-10-03T12:34:56.789012") instead of datetime object
* **GraphScout Workflows** - Multi-agent paths now execute completely, enabling sophisticated cognitive architectures and reasoning patterns
* **Performance Benefits** - Eliminated JSON serialization errors improving workflow reliability and trace generation success rate

> **Production Ready**: This release fixes critical production issues preventing GraphScout multi-agent routing and agent output serialization, establishing OrKa as a reliable platform for sophisticated multi-agent cognitive architectures.
