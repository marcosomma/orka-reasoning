This intelligent routing reduced computational overhead and focused the model on high-value content generation, as evidenced by the successful formatting of a narrative response. Subsequent attempts to apply the technical_report_formatter and executive_summarizer failed, underscoring the importance of context-aware tool selection--a gap that GraphScout's routing helped mitigate by steering the process toward compatible modules. Overall, GraphScout's decision engine acted as a meta-optimizer, improving efficiency, reducing error rates, and ensuring that the final synthesis was grounded in the system's actual capabilities and available evidence."

Each router or switch examines the destination IP address (or MAC address for local traffic) in the packet header and consults its routing table, which is populated by dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF, BGP, or RIP, or by static configurations. The routing protocol exchanges information with neighboring devices to build a topology map and compute the best path based on metrics like hop count, bandwidth, or delay. Once the next hop is determined, the device forwards the packet toward that hop, often stripping or adding headers as it crosses network boundaries. In large-scale internets, BGP handles inter-domain routing, while OSPF or IS-IS manage intra-domain paths. The process ensures that data packets traverse the most efficient and reliable routes, adapting to network changes in real time."
