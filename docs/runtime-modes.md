# OrKa Runtime Modes

## Sequential (Default)
Agents are executed in order. Ideal for deterministic flows.

## Router (Dynamic)
A `router` agent decides the next agent(s) based on prior outputs. Enables branching and fallback.

## Decision Tree (ORCA-CORE)
Dynamic trees based on cascading conditions. Defined via nested route maps and fallback logic. Requires private repo.

## Retry/Fallback (ORCA-CORE)
Define retry chains per agent. Useful for failure tolerance:
```yaml
  fallback:
    - search_agent
    - final_output
```

## Streaming (live) ⚠️ BETA

> **Beta Release**: The streaming runtime is functional but has known limitations, including context loss across conversation turns. See [STREAMING_GUIDE.md](./STREAMING_GUIDE.md) for details.

The streaming regime adds an event-driven runtime with low-latency refreshes. It is transport-agnostic: use it for text-only chat or with an external voice stack. Voice is optional metadata inside invariants and is not required for operation.

- Enable with environment variable ORKA_ENABLE_STREAMING=1.
- Start with: `orka streaming run <config> --session <id>`.
- YAML must set orchestrator.mode: streaming and can define executor_invariants and prompt_budgets.

**Known Issues**:
- Satellites overwrite context on each turn (conversation memory loss)
- No persistent session storage
- Limited context accumulation
