It\u2019s normal to pause and reassess, but you don\u2019t have to give up just yet. One way to make the dream feel more doable is to break it into tiny, clear steps\u2014think of each step as a small win that builds confidence. For example, if your dream is to write a book, you could start by setting a goal to write 200 words a day, then move to a chapter outline, and so on.\n\nSecond, consider reaching out for support. A mentor, a peer group, or even a career coach can offer fresh perspectives and practical advice.
